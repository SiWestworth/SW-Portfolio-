# Simon Westworth - Portfolio -

This is my portfolio site that I will be constantly updating as I progress my skills in web development and coding as a whole.

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the portfolio site.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that contains the styles and layout for the portfolio site.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that provides interactivity and functionality to the portfolio site.
- `images/`: A folder that contains all the images used in the portfolio site.
- `projects/`: A folder that contains subfolders for each project, each containing the necessary files and assets for that project.

Feel free to explore the different files and folders to learn more about my projects and coding skills!
